    "# Hybrid RAG — Colab Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs the heavy indexing and evaluation steps on Google Colab (GPU/large disk).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview:\n",
    "- Install dependencies\n",
    "- Mount Google Drive (save inputs/outputs there)\n",
    "- Upload your local project files (scripts, `fixed_urls.json`) or clone a GitHub repo\n",
    "- Run data collection, preprocessing, indexing, retrieval, question generation, and evaluation\n",
    "- Save results and a submission ZIP to Drive\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- If you haven't pushed your repo to GitHub, use the file upload cell below to upload the `scripts/` folder and `fixed_urls.json`/`corpus.json` etc.\n",
    "- For large models (sentence-transformers, flan-t5), Colab Pro/Pro+ or a GPU runtime is recommended."
